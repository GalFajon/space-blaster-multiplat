- android controls:
	- virtual joysticks
	- buttons with icons
	- add double tap for weapon switching

- bug fixes:
	- implement A*
	- fix enemy AI (especially bees)
	- fix intro cutscene positioning and overall ui positioning, make more story cutscenes the player can unlock as they beat many floors, upon beating X amount of floors
	the final cutscene unlocks, make the cutscenes an actual system so you can implement stuff like class character introductions etc

- expand level design:
	- room hazard that hurts the player on contact, enemy AI avoids it
	- rooms should be 1.5 as big as they are now
	- decorative destructible objects
	- turrets:
		- one fires either in a set direction or all four based on a timer
		- one fires directly towards the player
	- explosive objects, airlocks that fire a damaging ray in a direction etc.
	- room tilesets that change based on where you are (maybe just recolours)

- card system:
	- after each floor player MUST choose a card that gives the player an advantage but also makes some aspect of the game harder:
		- cards can either:
			benefits:
			- boost player or weapon stats, weapon and player stats should have maximum/minimum limits
			- give the player a skill they can use on a cooldown, only one skill and they overwrite
			- give the player a new primary/secondary weapon (all weapons are now cards)

			drawbacks:
			- increase enemy level (increasing their damage and movement speed, every enemy should have a fixed leveling system and stats that max out to avoid being broken)
			- add new rooms into the selection (rooms can be grouped by new enemy types or a theme)
			- reducing player stats in some way (e.g. removing max health)

		- the player is awarded card booster packs, they can also buy them, on opening, cards in the booster pack are added to the draw
		- the player can also choose from a number of premade classes with a starting loadout of weapon cards and a single weapon ability
			(note: the stats of these classes are determined by the drawbacks of the cards, no need for a player leveling system)

		- a menu is added where the player can view all the cards they have collected

- bosses:
	- add three boss encounters that appear after five or so floors
